// ---------------- Object Destructuring ----------------

const anotherObj = {
  instructor: "Mutee Ur Rehman",
  courseName: "Front End Web",
  fees: 999
};

// Traditional way to access a property
console.log(anotherObj.instructor);

// Destructuring the object
const { instructor: ins } = anotherObj;
console.log(ins); // Output: Mutee Ur Rehman



// ---------------- React Props Destructuring ----------------

// In React, props are often destructured directly in the function parameter
const Navbar = ({ company }) => {
  // You can now use 'company' directly instead of writing props.company
  console.log(company);
};

// Example usage of the Navbar component (in actual React code)
Navbar({ company: "Mutee" });



// ---------------- JSON Overview ----------------

/**
 * JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used
 * for storing and exchanging data, commonly between a client and a server.
 *
 * âœ… JSON replaced XML in most modern APIs due to its simplicity and compatibility with JavaScript.
 *
 * âœ… JSON data is often in the form of an object, but it can also be an array of objects.

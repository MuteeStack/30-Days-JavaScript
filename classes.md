## Javascript and classes

no initially javascript doesn't have classes but classes were introduced in ecmascript 2015 ES6 
javascript is a prototype based language

## object
objects are collection of properties(variables) and methods(functions)
for ex: toUpperCase toLowerCase new

## OOPs Why
because we get spagatti code therefore in order to fix this we have to write clean code
in order to make sevices to use again in the code reuseability

## parts of OOPs

object literal // this means that we are literally taking object for example 2 literally means 2 the objects are just object literals

-constructor (new keywork is genrally constructor helps to create new instances)
-classes
-prototype
instances (new , this)

## 4 pillars

abstraction (hide details like fetch hides everything it is doing in the background)
encapsulation (we hide data and we can give access which data they can use and which data they cannot use)
polymorphism (poly means many morphism mean things a single method doing many things is polymorphism)
inheritance

<!-- I past time we use XHR xmlhttprequest it is very powerful still used today  
 xhr is generally based on ajax (async javascript and xml) based it dont have things like aysnc await but it has  constructor or states for example ready state 
 0=unsent You didn't send any request 
 1=open you send the request only 
 2=headers_recieved which means that they  have recived your header but not data or anything else
 3=loading which do that how much of data has stored or data is compeletly stored or not it is also done now as well but nowadays it is not done throught these numbers done independently 
 4=done operation has been done now dataor request has been send from our side now the reciever have to manage the data -->
